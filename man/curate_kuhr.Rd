\arguments{
\item{diagnoses}{Diagnostic codes (see \code{available_variables(source=\"npr\")})}

\item{code_system}{can be "ICPC" (the default) or "ICD10"}

\item{primary_care_only}{the default is to use only primary care data sources
from kuhr (so this option is set to TRUE); if you have other data sources in
your kuhr datafile, set this to FALSE}

\item{recursive}{also include sub-codes of codes you have provided in the
diagnoses field? Defaults to TRUE (only used with code_system = "ICD10")}

\item{exclusions}{codes to exclude - always non-recursive (i.e., only the
specific codes you provide will be excluded from individual-level summaries, not sub-codes)
(only used with code_system = "ICD10")}

\item{group_all}{If TRUE, will treat all your codes as a single diagnosis
for the purpose of summarising; defaults to FALSE}

\item{dx_groupname}{If group_all is TRUE, this string is used to label the
vareiables pertaining to the grouped diagnoses}

\item{dx_owners}{Whose diagnoses do you want to count? Dataset is returned as
one row per pregnancy, but you can get the diagnoses relevant to any
combination of "child", "father", and "mother"; the default is "child"}

\item{kuhr_full}{if you already have the KUHR data loaded in memory, you can
save some time by providing the name of the R object here; note
that there are specific requirements for the structure of this file (see
Details) below.}

\item{moba_data_root_dir}{Where is the raw MoBa phenotypic data? (default
is for p471)}

\item{kuhr_data_root_dir}{Where is the raw NPR phenotypic data? (default
is for p471)}

\item{kuhr_filenames_override}{If the KUHR filenames are not YEAR_Data_KUHR.csv,
what are they?}

\item{linkage_file_root_dir}{Where are the linkage files? (default
is for p471)}

\item{kuhr_linkage_filename}{What is the name of the linkage file? (default
is for p471)}

\item{PDB}{What is the PDB code for your TSD project? (default
is for p471)}

\item{moba_data_version}{What version is the MoBa data you are linking to? Defaults to
12}
